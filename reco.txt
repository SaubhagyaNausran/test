Reconnaisance is the practice of covertly discovering and collecting information about a system.
Like many cybersecurity terms, reconnaissance derives from military language, where it refers to
 a mission with the goal of obtaining information from enemy territory. 

There are two main types of reconnaissance: active and passive reconnaissance. 

With active reconnaissance, hackers interact directly with the computer system and 
attempt to obtain information through techniques like automated scanning or manual 
testing and tools like ping and netcat.  Active recon is generally faster and more
 accurate, but riskier because it creates more noise within a system and has a higher
 chance of being detected.


Passive reconnaissance gathers information without directly interacting with systems,
 using tools such as Wireshark and Shodan and methods such as OS fingerprinting to gain information.
